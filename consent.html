						This is an academic research project conducted through the University of Pennsylvania. In this game, evidence will appear on screen indicating the location of a source. You're job will be to determine if the evidence suggests the source is above or below the line in the center of the screen. There will be 6 blocks of trials. The task will take about 45 minutes to complete.
